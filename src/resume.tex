\section{Work Experience}

\experience{Algorithm Engineer}{Xiaomi - New Business Department}{Aug 2022}{now}{
    \noindent Working towards enabling camera AI algorithms on power-constraint mobile devices for better user experience.
    \achievement{
        \tech{AI Video Raw Denoising}: 
        \achievement{
            A comprehensive solution for AI video denoising given any specific sensor. We established a complete process including noise model calibration, RGB-to-Raw unprocessing, baseline model training and finetuning using real-world samples.
        }
        \achievement{
            Participated in \tech{model deployment} on a high-end mobile platform. Worked on floating-point model training and mixed-precision model quantization (including PTQ and QAT). The resulting NPU inference performance is \tech{80fps@4K}.
        }
        \achievement{
            Independently responsible for a research project for \tech{night-mode capture preview}. The algorithm is expected to combine bayer downsampling and denoising which would decrease power consumption (lower resolution) and reduce noise for higher possible brightness. The quantized model achieved \tech{better detail and noise performance} than existing platforms (PQ certified).
        }
    }
    \achievement{
        \tech{AI-PP2PD (Autofocus)}
        \achievement{
            Being core of the overall autofocus algorithm (PDAF), ai-pp2pd (phase pixel to phase difference) aims at calculating the distance between two phase pixel raw images, hence determining the ideal in-focus motor position.
        }
        \achievement{
            Responsible for developing the complete training and evaluating scheme of ai-pp2pd. We train the network in two subsequent phases, using artificial samples generated from public datasets and collected raw images labeled with CDAF algorithms. The results on test set show a significantly higher accuray than traditional algorithm (\tech{0.98 vs 0.83}). 
        }
        \achievement{
            We carefully designed the model structure to meet the stringent power budget. The total computaional power of the model is reduced to \tech{0.5 GFLOPs} after quantization. 
        }
    }
    \achievement{
        \tech{ISP/DPU Auto Calibration}
        \achievement{
            Worked on an offline platform for efficient ISP/DPU parameter auto-calibration. The system utilized optimization algorithms (tpe, nsga...) to find the optimal parameter combination that achieves best image quality (measured in IQA).
        }
        \achievement{
            Adapted ISP brightness modules and DPU pipeline to existing auto-calibration platform. Developed \tech{parameter generation methods} and \tech{IQA algorithms} according to different systems. The auto-calibrated parameters achieved better performance than parameters calibrated by hand in several PQs.
        }
        \achievement{
            Explored and developed new auto-calibration framework based on \tech{deep reinforcement learning algorithms}. The new framework can access various reinforcement methods (HPO, TRPO, etc.) which achieves twice as fast convergence speed on DPU autotuning tasks (800 rounds vs 2000 rounds).
